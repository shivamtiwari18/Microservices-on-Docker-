# Microservices-on-Docker-


I have done Docker, Git, and AWS  and then I create a project on a Combination of these tools.
I have deployed a Website as a microservice using VS Code as IDE.
After that, I created a Dockerfile for the Individual Microservice present in the project.
Eventually, push the code on Git for version control and further clone that code in Docker for creating an image.
Furthermore, hosting microservices inside the containers and accessing this website from the public IP Address. 
This project is so special as it helped me understand the practical aspect of Docker more clearly.
