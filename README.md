# Microservices-on-Docker-

I have done Docker, Git, and AWS  and then I create a project on a Combination of these tools.
I have deployed a Website as a microservice using VS code as IDE.
After that I created a Dockerfile for the Individual Microservice present in the project.
Eventually pushing the code on Git for version control further cloning that code in Docker for creating an image.
Furthermore, hosting microservices inside the containers and access this website from the public IP Address.
